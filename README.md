# FUTURE_INTERNS_DS_03
# Student Feedback Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback ratings on different teaching aspects such as subject knowledge, clarity of explanations, use of presentations, assignments difficulty, doubt-solving willingness, course structuring, student support, and course recommendation relevance.

Using the numeric ratings, it derives statistical summaries, visualizes trends, and generates synthetic textual feedback for sentiment analysis with TextBlob.

## Data Source
- Dataset: Student feedback ratings from a survey dataset (`student_feedback.csv`).
- The data includes 1001 entries covering multiple teaching aspects rated on a scale.

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and duplicate removal.
- Descriptive statistics for numeric ratings.
- Visualizations including bar charts for average ratings, pie charts for rating distribution, and heatmaps showing correlations.
- Synthetic textual comment generation based on rating thresholds.
- Sentiment analysis of synthetic comments using TextBlob.
- Visualization of sentiment distribution.

## Usage
To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload `student_feedback.csv` in the working directory.
3. Open `Future_Interns_DS_03.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- textblob
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate actual textual feedback for richer sentiment analysis.
- Explore advanced NLP techniques on real comments.
- Add interactivity to visualizations.
